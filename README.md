# Cloud_Development_A
This is a record of all of my submissions for my Cloud Development A course

The first part consisted of a website with static webpages, which could be seen by clicking a link

the second part was more involved. A database was to be created for users, products and orders
The goal was to make an e-commerce website in which a person could request to advertise their project on this website. They would first be verified by an Admin, then their art will be added to the website.
When a client wants to order a product, they can add it to their cart, and it goes to an order tab, where an Admin can approve its sale. On the customers page, they will get a notification for whether the
order was process or denied.
